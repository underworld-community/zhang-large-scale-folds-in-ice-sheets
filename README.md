Code for the revising manuscript, Zhang et al., Ice Modeling Indicates Formation Mechanisms of Large-scale Folding in Greenland’s Ice Sheet.

Large-scale stratigraphic folds have been universally observed in the ice-penetrating radargrams of Greenland’s ice sheet. 

Here we use the full-Stokes code Underworld2 to simulate ice movements in three-dimensional convergent flow, mainly concerning ice anisotropy due to crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), vertical viscosity and density contrasts in ice layers, and bedrock topography.
