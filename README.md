Airborne radio‐echo sounding (RES) data reveal internal ice layering and large‐scale folding (up to >100 m, sometimes even 1 km fold amplitude) in several regions of Greenland's ice sheet. However, there is no consensus yet on how these folds form.

Here we use the full-Stokes code Underworld2 to simulate ice movements in three-dimensional convergent flow, mainly concerning ice anisotropy due to crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), vertical viscosity and density contrasts in ice layers, and bedrock topography.
